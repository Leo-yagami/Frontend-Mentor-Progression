## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned more about minimum width and how I can use it so that my card doesn't unecessarily keep scaling down since its width is a viewport width value

### Continued development

I really want to standardize my responsive coding workflow. I feel as though I am not following a proper system to make the elements responsive rather I am just randomly making changes so that it passes the design requirement
